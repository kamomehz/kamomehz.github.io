About Question on Environmental Policy,
Our Key Group ideas are to 
-	Focus on both economic and environmental aspects and comprehensively analyze the impacts of the targets.
-	A hybrid energy system can solve the problem of instability of solar and wind power, also maximize benefits.

We consider Best energy mix are
-	Both wind and solar energy, because there are still a large room of improvements.

Next, About MSW generation and waste management in China

A research suggests that in 2017, Chinese MSW generation rate is 0.7 kg/capita/day
Then, Total generation could be calculated as product of population and this rate.
So, estimation result is 0.37 billion ton/year

Next topic is waste management in China

According to statistics, in 2019, 
the amount of MSW collection is 0.24 billion ton
It means, a large part of MSW generation is collected
Currently, almost all of collected MSW has been properly treated.

Here are Two ideas of improving waste management
The one is increasing MSW treatment capacity,
The other is garbage sorting
#### 60s

Next topic is another estimation.
The graph on the lower right corner shows MSW structure in China.
Since calorific value of each category is given,
the result is 19 Mega- joule / kg

Next step is multiplying the calorific value and Total generation,
Meanwhile, If we consider heat loss, the final result is about 400 billion kwh per year

the most benefit of waste to power is recycling.
On the other hand, MSW produce harmful gases and has more cost.
